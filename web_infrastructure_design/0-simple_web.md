<h1>Web infrastructure design</h1>

![exo0](Task0.png)


<p>A server is a computer or system that provides resources, services, or data to other computers, known as clients, over a network. Servers can be physical or virtual, and they run an operating system like Ubuntu.

The Domain Name Server (DNS) translates a domain name into an IP address to make accessing the server easier than using a public IP address.

Servers come in different types, including web servers, application servers, and database servers. A web server serves static web pages to clients, while an application server computes dynamic content for applications. The database server stores application data to optimize data processing.

Servers communicate with users' computers using the HTTP protocol and operate on a TCP/IP network.

The presence of redundancy is crucial to avoid single points of failure. A single server without redundancy can be a single point of failure.

When deploying new code, a web server may require a restart, leading to a temporary website downtime.

Lastly, it's essential to note that infrastructure should be scalable to handle traffic exceeding the server's capacity. Lack of scalability can lead to performance issues.

In summary, servers play a vital role in delivering services over the internet, but they need proper management to ensure website and application availability and performance.</p>
